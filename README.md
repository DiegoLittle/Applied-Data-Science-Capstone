<H3>Introduction/Business Problem</H3>

Interstate 35 is a major highway that reaches from Laredo, Texas all the way to Duluth, Minnesota for a total length of 1,568 miles. This interstate highway runs through the middle of the capital of Texas, Austin where it makes a cultural, economic, and urban divide. Prior to the civil rights movement, there were laws forcing black residents to live east of the highway. By investigating discrepancies in data, I aim to find out how the effects of the cities' racist past still linger today.

<H3>Data Description</H3>

I will compile Austin zip codes and their coordinates to be used in the Foursquare API. Leveraging the foursquare API, I'll find suggested locations in each of the zip codes and then aquire each venues details. This will provide metrics such as rating, price, category, hours,etc. This data the modeled in various ways such as clustering and linear regression. Do clusters of venues appear divided by the I-35? Or do average ratings of venues decrease traveling eastbound?
